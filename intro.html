Hello!

I recently graduated from Western 
Governors University with a 
Bachelor's in Cybersecurity. I'm 
currently seeking an entry level/
junior position as a Information
Security/ Cybersecurity/ SOC Analyst.

Although my professional experience 
is lacking, I am passionate about 
cybersecurity and excel as a member 
of a team. I have been known by 
previous employers as an individual 
that loves to learn, exhibits 
initiative and leadership skills. I
enjoy thinking critically and
solving challenges.

I'm quick to help others and 
frequently volunteer for additional 
work.

Previous employers have been impressed 
with my adaptability and ability to 
follow process in critical environments.

I look forward to meeting you, and I'm 
excited to jumpstart my career.

Have a great day!


Shaun Christian
